# APFproject

This branch is a fixed branch that allow users to duplicate works from \<include paper when published\>.
The project aims at testing different versions of APF and how they combine together, in differents environments.
Tested features: bounded attractive force, addition of a tangential force, addition of a inertia inspired force, dynamic adjustments of forces' coefficients when detecting local minima.
The figures below aim at showing the different behaviors found.
